# ML on M1 mac

Everything here is the thinking as of 11/03/2022.

m1* macs are:

- defined as all macs from original m1 all the way to the latest apple silicon (m1, m1 pro, m1 max, m1 ultra, m2)
- practically, tested on original m1 mac mini running macOS Ventura 13.0 (22A380) with vs code and terminal

This document shows the steps to get ML to work on an M1 based mac:

- Package manager and python version
  - Options: venv+pip, miniconda+(conda-forge/pip), miniforge, anaconda, mamba, mambaforge
  - miniconda3 now supports m1* macs with python 3.9.latest. So, use this to create the conda environment:

## Classical ML

  ```sh
  conda create --name=ml_py_lt_3_10 "python<3.10"
  # if any conda environment is active, even base, then deactivate it first
  conda deactivate
  conda activate ml_py_lt_3_10
  ```

- The core python stack consists of the following libraries (in a very subjective order based on the thinking: "I must make this work before I can make that work"):
  - numpy - `conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib`
  - matplotlib - `conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib`
  - scipy - `conda install -c conda-forge scipy`
  - pandas - `conda install -c conda-forge pandas`
  - scikit-learn - `conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn`
  - seaborn - `conda install -c conda-forge seaborn` (which includes statsmodels)

## Tensorflow 2 on M1 Mac

- Tensorflow 2 has been compatible with M1 macs via Apple Metal for a while now 
  - official instructions [here](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/) fail with grpcio install - see [open issue](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/25082)
  - next tried [this](https://wandb.ai/tcapelle/apple_m1_pro/reports/Deep-Learning-on-the-M1-Pro-with-Apple-Silicon---VmlldzoxMjQ0NjY3)
    - Use tf_apple.yml from [here](https://github.com/tcapelle/apple_m1_pro_python/blob/main/tensorflow/tf_apple.yml)
      - change the name of the environment as needed (from tf2 in the file) - tf2_metal
      - (remove wandb and fastcore if not needed)
    - `conda env create --file=tf_apple.yml`
    - deactivate previous environments till no environment remains - call repeatedly - `conda deactivate`
    - activate the environment - `conda activate tf2`
    - run a test tensorflow script like the one in [this article section 4. Verify](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/)
    - this environment also has jupyter, so you can run tensorflow in a notebook:
      - first, install the environment as a kernel in jupyter - `python -m ipykernel install --user --name tf2_metal --display-name "Python3.9.13(tf2_metal)"`
      - launch `jupyter notebook`
      - create a new notebook
      - paste tensorflow code (like the [code from before](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/)) into this cell
      - run the cell

## Pytorch on M1 Mac

- Try [this article](https://wandb.ai/capecape/pytorch-M1Pro/reports/PyTorch-Runs-On-the-GPU-of-Apple-M1-Macs-Now-Announcement-With-Code-Samples---VmlldzoyMDMyNzMz#-run-this-benchmark-and-contribute-to-this-table-ðŸš€) steps from September 2022
  - deactivate conda (as many times as needed to get out of any environment) - `conda deactivate`
  - Create conda environment: `conda create --name="pytorch_metal" python`
  - Activate the environment: `conda activate pytorch_metal`
  - Install the pytorch nightly build: `pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu`
  - Run code from [pytorch tutorial](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/blob/master/beginner_source/basics/quickstart_tutorial.py)
  - Try running from jupyterlab - first, install it: `pip install jupyterlab`
  - Install the kernel into jupyter: `python -m ipykernel install --user --name pytorch_metal --display-name "Python3.10.6(pytorch_metal)"`
  - Launch jupyterlab: `jupyter lab`
  - Paste pytorch code (like [the one before](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials/blob/master/beginner_source/basics/quickstart_tutorial.py)) into the cell
  - run the cell

## Huggingface transformers with pytorch on M1 Mac

- We have to pick an environment that runs pytorch or tensorflow (maybe we can combine both, but that is for another day). For now, picking pytorch.
  - Clone the pytorch_metal environment created above to create new environment pytorch_metal_transformers: `conda create --name pytorch_metal_transformers --clone pytorch_metal`
  - deactivate (multiple times if needed), then activate the new environment: `conda activate pytorch_metal_transformers`
  - Install transformers from huggingface: `conda install -c huggingface transformers`
  - TIP: You may need to deactivate and reactivate again (installing new libraries sometimes switches python to base python - always check `which python` - if the python is not from current env folder, then deactivate and reactivate, and check again)
  - Run some simple transformers code - you can find examples in the [quicktour](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.24.0/en/quicktour)

## TODOs

- ðŸ¤—Training, fine tuning, inference on huggingface transformers
- ðŸ¤— with tensorflow
- Jax
- ðŸ¤—Diffusers
- ðŸ¤—Accelerators
- Pytorch lightning
- Kitchen sink torch stack (with all other common libraries)
- haven't really tried many others: parquet, tqdm, boken, ...
